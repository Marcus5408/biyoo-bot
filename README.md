# Biyoo Bot

A simple little bot I made. It only has one function right now, which is a shameboard funtion. Check the comments in the code for info getting stuff set up.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the requirements
3. Get your bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
4. Put the bot token in a `.env` file in the main directory/ same directory as this `README.md` file
5. Adjust source and target channels in the code
6. Run the bot
